        <h1> Epicurus </h1>
        <p><em> <strong> Philosopher. Founder of Epicureanism </strong> </em></p>
        <p>He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho,[3] and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as "the Garden", in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects</p>
